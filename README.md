## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition
How does the MechaCar peform against the competition? Using a few key metrics, we have crafted a design study to measure their success compared to vehicles of the same price.

Key Metrics:
* Safety Rating
* Vehicle Price
* Resale Value
* Annual Maintenance Costs
* Miles per Gallon (mpg)

Hypotheses
Null: Based on the key metrics, MechaCar performs similarily to competition at the same price.
Alternative: Based on key metrics, MechaCar performs better than the competition performed at the same price.

Statistical Test and Data
An ANOVA test would be best used to complete this analysis. Comparing the different car companies based on the same key metrics. Which car company performs better based on these metrics? Similar to what Consumer Reports does. First, find the average of these metrics across the whole population (all competition included) and then run a test to see if the average of MechaCar is significantly different than that average. Above average (positive) would indicate better performance and below average (negative) would indicate poorer performance. The data needed to complete this analysis would include the key metrics listed above for at least 3 years of data to have a more inclusive analysis.
